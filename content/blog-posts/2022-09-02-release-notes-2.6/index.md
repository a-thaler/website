You probably know the song ["Kyma, Kyma, Kyma, Kyma, Kyma chameleon"](https://youtu.be/JmcA9LIIXWw?t=44). As you can see with the new release, Kyma, like chameleons, easily adapts to new surroundings. In 2.6 we introduced a new version of APIRule, improved the `function.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) and, provided configurable logging. But that's not all! Read on to find out more about the 2.6 release!

## API Exposure

### Exposing and securing multiple services

This Kyma release comes with a new version of APIRule, featuring exposing and securing multiple services. Now itâ€™s possible to define a service per rule. Read more about the [APIRule custom resource (CR)](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/05-technical-reference/00-custom-resources/apix-01-apirule).

## Observability

### Configurable Logging

With the new [Telemetry component](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/main/01-overview/main-areas/observability/obsv-04-telemetry-in-kyma/), Kyma 2.6 introduces configurable logging. Now you can configure how logs are processed. Besides pushing all application logs to the in-cluster Loki service, you can integrate your own logging backends with Kyma. Furthermore, you can now define criteria for log collection, parsers, filters, and outputs. 
For more information, see the [migration guide](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/release-2.6/docs/migration-guide-2.5-2.6.md).

### Eventing Dashboard

This Kyma release comes with a consolidated Grafana dashboard for Eventing called **NATS Delivery**, so you can monitor the published and dispatched events in one, holistic view.

## Serverless

### Improved Function CRD

With Kyma 2.6, the new `v1alpha2` version of the `function.kyma-project.io` CRD is available. It improves usability, and paves the way for a stable `v1` version, which is just around the corner.

The `v1alpha2` changes include:

* More structured information about the Function source.  The source subobject describes either the sources, in the case of inline Functions, or Git reference in the case of Git Functions. GitRepository CRD will no longer be used to store information about the Git sources.
- Build-time and run-time resource configuration were moved under the common parent field called **resourceConfiguration**.
* Experimental support for external Kubernetes resource scalers (for example via KEDA ScaledObject API) using scale subresource.

The following versions of CRDs are deprecated:
- `serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1/Function`
- `serverless.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1/GitRepository`

You don't need to update your Function templates immediately. Kyma provides a conversion webhook that handles the conversion on the fly between the deprecated `v1alpha1` and the new `v1alpha2` versions. This automatic conversion is a temporary convenience; it will be removed after a 6-month depreciation period.

## Service Mesh

### Istio Sidecar injection

Starting with this Kyma version, new workloads no longer have Istio sidecars injected by default. If you want automatic sidecar injection, you must [enable it](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/) yourself. Learn more about the [benefits of having your workload as a part of the Istio service mesh](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/01-overview/main-areas/service-mesh/smsh-03-istio-sidecars-in-kyma/). 
  
Despite the change, Kyma continues to update the sidecars of workloads that are part of the Istio service mesh.

### Istio upgraded to 1.14.3

In this release, Kyma upgraded Istio from 1.14.1 to 1.14.3. For more details, read the official [Istio 1.14.3 release notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.14.x/announcing-1.14.3/).
